  <p>While I worked on item design last week Zuzanna was working on the tiles for our game. Seeing her designs has made me excited as we can get
    a clearer idea of how the game will look. The first floor, the bedroom, has now been completed. This design includes pink walls as it is a
    princesses bedroom. I plan to draw furniture items such as a bed and wardrobe, in the first level the princess must fight enchanted moving furniture.
    For the other levels I intend on drawing more furniture and objects but these will not be able to move. They will be solid objects that fill the rooms,
    the player nor any enemies will be able to walk through these objects. This will add to the game experience as the player will have to navigate through
    the levels accordingly, adding some slight difficulty to the game as well as making the game more visually appealing.</p>

  <p>Instead of relying on pre-made tile sets, Zuzanna made the decision to create her own 60×60 tiles. While the process itself isn’t overly
    complicated, it’s definitely time consuming. Still, we believe it’s worth the extra effort as it gives us complete creative control over
    the visuals and overall feel of our game. So far, she has completed the Bedroom level tiles, including walls, corner walls, and other
    structural elements and is currently working on the door frames. The floor tiles are also finished, but after discussing them with Luigi, who’s handling
    room randomisation, he suggested darkening them slightly to improve the overall aesthetic and atmosphere. She plans to edit those before we implement
    the final version.</p>

    <p>Another key element we’re trying to sort out soon is the game’s audio and sound design. That responsibility is mainly with Niamh, but Zuzanna has
      also been helping by compiling a folder of sound effects she can work from. Most of these aren’t original creations, they’re sourced from free
      libraries, so we’ll be crediting the original creators if we decide to use those sounds in our final game. These sounds work great for smaller
      effects like footsteps, chests opening, ambient nature sounds like birdsong, and more. But Niamh is also open to creating these sounds herself.
      One challenge still ahead is creating or finding monster sound effects, especially something like a dragon’s roar.
      Unless we come across a ready made one that fits perfectly, we may need to experiment with layering or editing existing sounds. If all goes well,
      we’re hoping to start testing the ability to walk around the map this week and see how the room generation is coming together in action. It’ll be a
      big step forward to see everything start to come to life on screen.</p>

  <p>I am beginning to feel more hopeful about our project as people have begun engaging more in the project, and we are begining to see how the finished
  product will look. This week I have begun to work on monster designs for each level.</p>

      of Zuzanna's hard work, as she drew each tile separately and I assembled this example on my own drawing software.</div>

  <p>This week I once again worked on designing items/characters for our game. It was a long process as I struggled to establish a consistent
    style for the art as I do not have any experience working with pixel art and such a small canvas. I have created a process for creating the art.
    I begin by searching for images of the particular item I want to create and then using a pixel filter to understand how the item should look
    in a pixelated format. I then search for similar assets in other games to see how others replicate an items likeness in such a small format.
    Using the information I have gathered, I create a 100X100 canvas on my drawing software, FireAlpaca and begin drawing. I was originally using
    SAI paint tool to create my drawings, as I have used this software in the past and I find the software easy to use. Unfortunately it is not a
    free software and my free trial ran out. I spent some time researching and testing other pieces of software, but I found them far less efficient.
    Eventually, I came across FireAlpaca which I found easy to use and had a similar user interface to SAI paint tool.</p>

  <p>So far in our development of items, we’ve brainstormed a variety of item concepts, each inspired by elements of fairy tales and fantasy.
    Many of these items are integrated directly into our core gameplay mechanics, particularly puzzles. One idea Zuzanna suggested involves
    structuring the game across four distinct floors, each themed around a different part of a castle, in keeping with the narrative setting
    of a Princess’ tower. This layout would support our puzzle design. For instance, the second floor would be a kitchen. We plan to include a
    puzzle, which I proposed, where players must gather ingredients to craft an ‘antidote’ which would cure one of the rats under a spell. This
    rat would then take on a different appearance and act as a companion for the rest of the game, explaining each level to the player and
    assisting them. This week I had originally planned on working on more monster designs, but I decided to focus more on item design as it was the main
  focus of the team this week and would be more useful to those working on the code for our game at this moment in time.</p>

  <p>For the third floor, the Ballroom, we were inspired by the movie "Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses", where characters step on tiles in a
    specific sound sequence. Incorporating a similar mechanic would allow us to create a memorable auditory experience. However, our main
    challenge here is that no one on the team has prior experience with sound design. That said, two members have expressed interest in learning
    and taking on the sound technician role while the rest of us focus on visual and gameplay elements. </p>

  <p>While brainstorming, we also made the decision to scrap the crystal ball idea I mentioned previously. I proposed the Rat idea as an alternative
  as this would introduce the first puzzle of the game as well as incorporating a more interactive aspect to the game. I believe this will
  immerse players in the world we are creating and hopefully make the game more enjoyable to be able to see a reoccurring character.</p>

  <ul>
    <p>Currently, we’ve thought of approximately 15 unique items, each with it's own effect. Items I've succeeded in creating so far are: </p>
    <li style="color: #39356c; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif">A Glass Slipper</li>
    <li style="color: #39356c; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif">True Loves Kiss (potion)</li>
    <li style="color: #39356c; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif">Magic Mirror</li>
    <li style="color: #39356c; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif">Enchanted Apple</li>
    <li style="color: #39356c; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif">A Rose</li>
    <li style="color: #39356c; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif">Fairy Dust</li>
  </ul>

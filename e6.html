  <p>Zuzanna and I have also worked on improving our communication and time management, particularly because we’ve had to share a single
    drawing tablet between us. Unfortunately, my own drawing tablet is currently broken. To manage this, we’ve been alternating weekly use
    of the tablet, which has slowed our design process. However, I’ve found ways to continue contributing even without
    the tablet. Due to the small canvas resolution, I’ve been able to create pixel art using my mouse. While this method is far more
    time consuming, it allows me to stay productive when I don't have access to the tablet. This workaround has been fairly effective for
    item design, but I find character design more difficult without a pen and tablet, due to the need for more precise detailing.</p>

  <p>This week, we faced considerable challenges with team engagement. Our group had agreed to hold weekly team meetings during the Tuesday Lab
    slot from 1–3pm. While we had previously encountered some attendance issues, that I thought overcame. Zuzanna and Caithlin informed me
    in advance that they’d be late due to other commitments, which I appreciated since they had completed last week’s tasks and still intended to
    attend. However, when I arrived at the lab, I was the only team member present. What was especially disheartening was that I had just walked to
    the lab with one of my teammates, who told me directly that he thought the meetings were “pointless,” and proceeded to book a gym session for
    that exact time, right in front of me. Although I was upset by this, I didn’t address this in the moment because we were friends and I didn’t want to
    create conflict. Zuzanna also tried to speak with him privately about the issue, but her efforts were not successful. The other two team members
    missed the lab entirely without offering any explanation. Because of this, I’m currently unclear on the status of the coding side of our project.
    I sent a message in the team group chat, listing the tasks that needed to be completed for next week and reiterating the expectation that any
    previously assigned work must be done. I also reminded everyone that if they were struggling with their role or had issues with their tasks, they
    should come to the meetings so we could find a solution together. Unfortunately, I received no response from any of the absent team members.</p>

  <p>While I understand that different roles come with varying levels of difficulty and may not be equally enjoyable, I’m disappointed by the lack
    of engagement from the team this week. I’m more than willing to help redistribute tasks if someone is struggling, particularly with coding,
    which could easily be shared among those who are more comfortable with it or pitch in where I can as I understand my job is considerably easier.
    I’ve always encouraged my teammates to talk to me if they’re finding something difficult, but I haven’t received any feedback. I’m unsure of how
    to move forward with this, as I don’t want to cause any tension that could further lower productivity. I recognise that everyone has their
    own personal circumstances, and I genuinely hope that everyone is working on their own parts independently, especially given that this project impacts all
    of our final grades.</p>

  <p>I find myself in a difficult position as producer. I do not want to take complete control of the group and create tension. This may lead to team members
  resenting me and thus not completing their work. But at the moment the team seems unmotivated and unbalanced. Without anyone to organise tasks and push
  for work to be done I do not believe this project will be completed. I’m doing my best to keep the project on track, but it’s becoming increasingly clear
    that maintaining motivation and coordination within the team is a real challenge. I don’t want to come across as controlling or overly critical,
    because I value having a respectful environment. I’ve been trying to lead by example by staying organised, communicating clearly, and encouraging
    people to reach out if they’re struggling, but lately, I’ve started to feel as though my efforts aren’t being taken seriously.
    There have been moments where it’s felt like my role and the time I’ve put into organising things aren’t respected by some members of the group.
    When people miss meetings without explanation, or disregard team decisions by openly prioritising other things, it creates a sense that the
    work, and by extension, the people who are putting in effort, just doesn’t matter to them. I don’t want to be seen as tyrannical or as someone
    who’s constantly chasing others to get things done, but I also feel a responsibility to ensure we all succeed.</p>

    <p>I’m trying to balance being understanding with being firm. I know that everyone has their own struggles and commitments outside of this module.
      What I and others do expect is mutual respect and an equal distribution of responsibility. I’m more than willing to adapt, compromise, or help
      wherever I can, but that can only work if people are willing to communicate and meet halfway. Right now, I’m unsure how to move forward
      when some members seem disengaged and unreceptive to attempts to collaborate. I care about this project, and I want us all
      to do well, but I can’t do it alone. </p>

  <p>This experience has made me reflect on the importance of time management, not only at an individual level, but also within a team dynamic.
    Personally, I’ve tried to stay on track by adapting to setbacks. However, the success of this game depends on shared responsibility. When everyone
    doesn’t adhere to agreed-upon schedules or doesn't communicate delays, it disrupts progress for the whole team. Time management is more than just
    meeting deadlines, it’s also about respecting everyone's time and effort. When people don’t show up or dismiss these sessions as unnecessary,
    it undermines our planning and puts more pressure on the rest of the group. Looking forward, I’m going to continue managing my time effectively
    and doing my part, while also trying to encourage others to do the same. I’m hoping that with a bit more structure and understanding, we can all
    work more cohesively in the coming weeks.</p>

  <p>Today’s meeting did not go as planned, and I am honestly very upset by the outcome. It’s deeply disappointing to
    feel like we may not have a finished game to submit by tomorrow. I feel that, as producer, I’ve failed in my responsibilities,
    and I take full accountability for the mistakes I’ve made throughout this project.</p>

    <p>The plan was to meet today and fully assemble the game. I had previously been assured by team members that this would be done,
      but unfortunately, we were not even close to having a finished product. Yesterday, Luigi informed us that he had completed several features:
      room randomisation, spawn points, basic player movement (which was actually Niamh’s task), enemy movement, and item drops. He mentioned that
      his item drop code relied on Jane’s battle code, and until he had that, his work couldn’t be tested properly. I wasn’t aware that these systems
      were dependent on one another, which reflects just how poor our team communication has been. I had been under the impression that items would
      spawn randomly in rooms, not drop from enemies, this was never clarified earlier. This confusion is on me for not clarifying this sooner and being
      presumptuous. Luigi also worked on the player movement, which Niamh had already completed separately. Her version included additional features like
      sound, and it was more polished overall. Luigi’s Unity implementation was also confusing, he had inserted the princess and rat enemies into the
      ballroom tilesets, which didn’t make much sense to me. I hoped we would be able to tweak or reuse his code and prefabs in our properly created
      levels, but the integration is not straightforward.</p>

    <p>Jane attended the meeting and was quietly working the entire time. From what I heard, her Unity software crashed the night before, meaning she
      lost progress and had to start over. I understand this must have been an incredibly stressful situation, and I appreciate that she continued to
      work despite the setback. Niamh’s gameplay was strong, but she struggled with implementing animations. The princess sprite could move correctly
      as a still image, but she couldn’t replace it with Caithlin’s animated versions. They worked together to try and resolve the issue but were still
      stuck by the time the meeting ended. Unfortunately, the loading screen animation I had asked Caithlin to work on last week was not completed.
      I didn’t want to complain, but I found it frustrating that she was annoyed with me for the size of the sprite in the loading screen I drew,
      especially since she hadn’t told me earlier that it would be a problem, and I could have easily fixed it. Zuzanna couldn’t attend due to a
      medical issue, which was completely understandable. </p>

      <p>I volunteered to make the main menu myself, and while I really struggled at first, I eventually found a tutorial and managed to complete it.
        I wasn’t able to use the custom buttons I had drawn, which was disappointing, but I took the approach of “something is better than nothing.”
        I uploaded all the assets to GitHub and encouraged others to do the same, offering to attempt to put together a basic version of the game.
        However, no one has taken me up on this offer so far. It became clear that the game wasn’t close to being assembled, as everyone still needed to
        finish or tweak their own parts. Luigi spent the entire meeting working on his development diary. When Caithlin asked him to help with player
        animation, he initially refused. Only after some persistence did he reluctantly agree. At around 8 p.m., Caithlin decided to go home, and the
        rest of the team followed soon after. Niamh and Jane said they would work together from home to continue developing the game.
        I was deeply upset after the meeting and called Zuzanna to express how I was feeling. She’s been a huge help in trying to keep the group together
        and moving forward, but I still have serious doubts about whether we’ll have anything finished to show. Jane and Luigi haven’t collaborated at
        all, despite the fact that their systems (battle mechanics and item drops) rely on each other. If we can't get enemy battles working in time,
        we’ve decided we’ll fall back on including Niamh’s puzzles and simply call it a day.</p>

    <p>Zuzanna has tried to salvage what she can. She asked Luigi to record a video of the player movement and said he agreed to send it to her, though
      I haven’t seen it yet. She also asked the team to record any working gameplay we could showcase, which I’ve also started doing. If we are not able to
      complete the game we are hoping to have a video of the main menu and some player and enemy movement to showcase. I feel totally in the dark right
      now, and that feeling is one of the worst parts of this whole experience. I’ve done what I can, I created artwork, built a main menu, uploaded
      assets, volunteered to assemble the game, but I feel helpless with so many missing pieces. We’ve agreed to meet tomorrow morning in the library
      to try and finish assembling what we can. I want to be hopeful, but at this point, I’m not feeling optimistic.</p>

    <p>I know that I’ve been highly critical of my team members throughout this diary, and while some of that frustration was valid, I also didn’t do
      enough myslef to fix the root of our problems. There was work being done, but the lack of communication made it feel like nothing was happening from
      my perspective, which led me to overreact or make unfair assumptions. I didn’t communicate consistently or clearly, and I let my own discomfort with
      confrontation stop me from checking in when I should have. When I did speak up, it was often too late and done out of frustration. I also fully
      admit I fell behind on deadlines myself at times, and I didn’t always manage my time or tasks as effectively as I should have. My understanding
      of games was limited from the start, which made it harder for me to guide the team. I know now that I should have taken a more active role in
      learning how all the systems worked and how they fit together. Despite everything, I’ve tried my best. I’ve worked hard, I’ve contributed
      consistently, and I’ve taken responsibility for making sure we had something to show. I just hope that by tomorrow, we’ll be able to pull
      something together.</p>

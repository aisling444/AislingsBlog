  <p>This week, I focused on creating the cutscenes for the game, and I found it to be one of the more challenging tasks
    I’ve taken on so far. Zuzanna had recommended that I work on a 1920×1080 canvas to match the resolution needed for Unity,
    but I quickly realised that I couldn’t replicate our usual pixelated art style at that scale. I tried multiple approaches
    but struggled to get the desired look. I began by using a pixel background to draw the shapes pixel by pixel, but this did not work
    due to the large size of the canvas. I then tried to use a square lineart tool to draw the shapes, but this was a very time consuming
    process and the lines did not line up perfectly. However, when drawing the buttons for the title screen, I did use this method. I
  felt that this did not look right so I also applied the pixel filter to this layer.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I decided to draw the scenes as I normally would and then apply a pixel filter to each layer afterward. While I’m not completely
      satisfied with the final result, I think this is the best I can manage at the moment with the tools and time I have. It was a good learning
      experience, even if the outcome wasn’t exactly what I envisioned.</p>

    <p>To make implementation easier, I uploaded both the full title image and the individual layers to GitHub. I assume the button images will need to
      be applied separately in Unity, though I’m unsure of the exact steps for that. Thankfully, Jane volunteered to handle the coding for the clickable
      title screen buttons, so I’m hoping we’ll be able to figure it out between us.</p>

  <p>Zuzanna and I also discussed how I would go about creating the cutscenes. Originally, we had planned to have cutscenes that would include detailed
  backgrounds and more detailed versions of the characters. Due to time constraints and the issues I had creating the title screen, we decided the best way
  to implement the scenes would be for the character to simply appear on the screen with a speech bubble. As Caithlin had already finished her animations,
  she volunteered to create these speech bubbles. She has not yet started on this task as she is unsure what to write in the speech bubbles. I am also
  unsure what to write, as the cutscences were mainly Zuzanna's idea and I do not want to stray too far from her vision. This is something
  I intend on tackling at the next team meeting.</p>

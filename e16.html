  <p>With the deadline upon us, it’s become clear that we will not have a finished game ready to upload to Itch.io.
    This is an incredibly disappointing outcome, especially considering how much time and effort the team put in throughout the semester. Earlier, I had
    hoped that we might be able to upload a playable version of Niamh’s bedroom level, as her work had been looking especially impressive. However, I
    haven’t received a response from her recently, and I realize now that I may have been asking for too much this close to the deadline. Last night,
    Luigi sent over a gameplay video of the systems he had implemented, and Niamh had uploaded footage of her gameplay along with the music she created
    to GitHub. Looking back of this footage, the princess looks fine but the objects look quiet off. I think this may be my fault, I was never
  approached about this issue, but I am thinking maybe the objects should not have been drawn on a 100X100 canvas. I wish I was aware of this sooner as
  I could have redrawn these assets to create a more polished final look, but unfortunately it is too late to fix this. Jane has not uploaded any of her files at this current moment.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, what held us back from reaching the finish line was the lack of a functioning attack system and fully implemented animations.
      These were crucial features, and without them, we were unable to tie all the components together into a working game. Despite our ambitions and
      scattered moments of good progress, this outcome feels like a missed opportunity.

    <p>Although we don’t have a finished product, I’m grateful for what we were able to create and document. The gameplay footage we’ve collected
  at least shows the potential our project had if things had been done differently.</p>

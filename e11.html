  <p>This week, there were some small improvements in team engagement. Niamh actually took initiative and organised a
    team meeting, even going as far as booking a private room in the library for us to work together. I really appreciated
    this effort, as it's the kind of collaboration I’ve been hoping to see more of from everyone. Unfortunately Luigi did not attend.</p>

  <p>However, unsurprisingly, communication once again became an issue. Despite our previous team decision to scrap the puzzle mechanic
    due to time constraints, Niamh had already finished the code for two puzzles. While I was slightly frustrated that this hadn’t been
    communicated earlier, I decided to support the effort by creating the assets needed for the puzzles, since it would at least give us an
    extra element to implement in the game. At this stage, I’m more focused on making sure we have something cohesive and polished rather than
    sticking strictly to our original plans. I drew the broken key peices needed for the bedrom level. In the begining, the princess will be
  trapped in her roomand must collect pieces of a broken key and assemble it to progress to the next level. Then I drew the ingredients needed for
  the kitchen potion to cure the rats under a spell. I am still unsure what the puzzles for the next rooms will even be.</p>

  <p>At another point last week Zuzanna and I organised a meeting in the library to work on the project. Unfortunately, Niamh was sick, which was a completely
  valid reason to not attend. Jane on the other hand, had originally told us she would be absent, as she was already in the library studying and did not want
  to leave. I pushed her to at least join us for a few minutes so we were all on the same page nd she agreed. She told us that she was researching a health
  system, something I had asked her to do in the early weeks of this project, and it would be ready to implement by next week, she then left. Luigi then arrived
  and expressed he was having some issues with room randomisation. I remembered another team speaking about encountering the same issue in the game presentation
  and suggested reaching out to this team for guidance. I do not know whether he followed through with this or not. We also asked him to upload the code
  he had to Github so Jane would be able to see it. He refused saying it was 'useless' unless implemented in Unity. I still encouraged him to upload to Github,
  as Zuzanna and I are conscious Luigi and Jane may use the same variable names in their own code which could cause problems down the line. He then stated he was not
  even a member of the Github repository I had created and sent out invites in the first week. It had taken him so long to accept the invite, that it had expired.
  I sent him another invite to the repository and at this current moment in time he had still not accepted said invite.</p>

  <p>Given how much of the project continues to fall on the same few people, I decided to speak with my lecturer about my concerns, specifically,
    that I don’t believe we’ll have a fully finished game by the deadline. He advised me that if I could show, through my dev diary, consistent
    evidence of my contributions and a clear record of others not following through on their responsibilities, I would not outright fail this module.
    He did highlight it was less than ideal that those who have been consistently working each week on this project are focused mainly on design,
    meaning we have less to show for our work. It was a frustrating but true observation. This conversation reassured me somewhat. I’ve worked really
    hard on this project and have put hours into planning, communicating, designing, drawing, and problem-solving. It’s disappointing to feel like so
    much of that work might be overshadowed by a lack of group coordination, but at least I now know that my own efforts won’t go unnoticed.
    And I do recognise the efforts of everyone in the group. Everyone has done at least one thing asked of them. Going forward, I’ll continue to do my
    best and document every step. I still hope the rest of the team steps up, but I’m also
    preparing myself to accept that not everyone may follow through. At the very least, I want to be proud of what I personally contributed to this
    project.</p>

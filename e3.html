  <p>This week while Zuzanna worked on some concept art for our game, including a first draft for our main character.
    Caithlin felt that the colours of the purple dress may be too dark and blend into the background of our game.
    I took this into account when I began working on some designs for the characters. I created very light colours
    for the princess so she would stand out against the setting of the game. I also think this could symbolise the
    good, ‘light’ princess in contrast with the dark, ‘evil’ surroundings.</p>

  <p>I drew variations of different versions of the rats to see how they would look, and which fitted our game the best.
    I gave the rats a green hue to show that they were 'under a spell' which made them attack, the rats would reurn to normal
    colours if the level is won.
    I tried to incorporate the kitchen theme by giving one rat a plate and fork as weapons and giving another rat a pot
    to wear as a hat. I personally think that we could use both designs in our game to add some variation to the level.
    I will discuss this with my team when I show them the designs. I ran into some issues with the pot and rate design
    as with the pixelated aesthetic we are using I struggled to get the right angel and shape for the pot. Eventually
    I decided to have the rat sitting in the pot to avoid this issue. While writing this entry I’ve come to realise I
    never saved the rat pot designs… I will redraw them.</p>

  <p>As producer I assigned tasks to be done this week. As I said above Zuzanna worked on some concept art for the
    rooms. Luigi researched room randomisation, and the code needed to achieve this. Caithlin worked on item designs.
    Nimah worked on the sound system to create background noises such as attack sounds, creaking and background music.
    And Jane researched health systems and attack systems for videos games and the code needed to achieve this.</p>

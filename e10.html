  <p>This week we were asked to present our game and the progress so far to our lecturer and peers in our allocated lecture time. Personally, I think
  ou presentation was terrible and reflects the attitude of our team so far. I am very disappointed in all of us, myself included. I will admit there have
  been times where I have fallen behind, not completed my work on time or communicated effectively but I at least try my best, and I do not think I can
  say the same for some other members of this group. Due to unforeseen circumstances that UL were aware of, Caithlin was unavailable this week and
  had an exemption. This was perfectly fine as she had completed most of her work anyway. Zuzanna took the lead on the slideshow, as she was the most comfortable
    with the writing and expressing herself clearly, something I have struggled with in this Dev Diary.

    <p>While working on the presentation, she encountered an ongoing issue that’s become increasingly noticeable throughout the project, a lack of
  involvement from several team members. I felt guilty that Zuzanna had taken on this responsibility on her own and offered to help in anyway I could.
  Zuzanna requested I send all the resources I had prepared, which I did. Luigi was the only other member who actively contributed to the actual
  creation of this presentation. This lack of collaboration significantly limited what could be included, particularly in terms of showcasing in-game
  content. For instance, sound design had to be practically ignored aside from a single slide with brief descriptions, simply because no one had
  uploaded anything to GitHub or shared it with the team. No one was given access to any materials that could’ve helped flesh out that section,
  which was disappointing. In the end, it was mainly Zuzanna and, to a lesser extent, Luigi who completed the presentation. Niamh and Jane contributed
  very little, and while I understand that people may be busy, it was disheartening to see so little input. Luigi volunteered to present the slideshow
  by himself, which was generous of him. However, the presentation did feel rushed, and the Q&A session that followed highlighted several gaps and areas
  for improvement. One suggestion that came up was the inclusion of special or unique rooms, inspired by games like The Binding of Isaac. While we’ve
  already ruled out the idea of a shop system (due to the absence of a currency mechanic), we are now considering other types of rooms, such as item
  rooms or boss challenge rooms.</p>

  <p>To be completely honest, I am very unsatisfied with our game presentation and how it reflected on us as a team, especially those who did put effort
  into the project so far. I feel slightly guilty accusing some members of not putting any effort in, but I have not seen any proof or communication
    about their work, so from my perspective it looks like only myself, Zuzanna and Caithlin have been the ones consistently working on the game.
  Yes, a few weeks ago I did see a snippet of Niamh's work on player navigation, but that is all I have seen of her work. Most of our team members were
  not keen on public speaking and presenting, that was fine I was happy to present alongside any other willing participants. Luigi, as stated above, said
  he would prefer to present alone, but also said if he could avoid presenting at all he would which I accepted and began preparing for the presentation
  under the assumption I would be presenting alone, as I had received no communication from Jane and Niamh on this matter. When I entered the lecture hall I
  met Niamh, who volunteered herself to join me in presenting which I appreciated as I believed it was a bad look for us to have only one member of the group presenting.
  Only a few minutes before we were called upon to present our game, Luigi told me not to go up and he would present alone. I proceeded to ask could I at least
  go up with him to answer questions and he refused. When we were called, he stood up and ignored my questions asking if he was sure. It was frustrating to see
    Luigi rush through a large portion of the slides, especially those covering important aspects of the game such as the background, characters,
    enemies, and items. These sections contained a lot of essential information, and the rushed delivery led to confusion among the audience,
    who began asking questions about mechanics that were already clearly outlined in the slides. I feel that it was a terrible look for our team as a whole
  for only one person to present, especially in such a rushed and unprepared manner.</p>

  <p>Another extremely frustrating element was the conversation I had with Luigi before this presentation. He was complaining to me about how he had spent
  three hours the night before preparing the room randomisation and how it was very difficult. This irritated me as I had been asking Luigi to work on
  this from the very start of this project, and he was only getting around to it now, in week 9. If the work was difficult and took him 3 hours to do,
  the room randomisation could have been done, comprehensively, a long time ago, and maybe by now we would be much farther alone in the development of our game
    as Luigi could have taken on another role that was ignored in our group.</p>

   <p> Although we had initially planned to include puzzle-based rooms, we’ve unfortunately had to drop that idea due to time constraints. A possible
     alternative could be item drops after room completion or rewards tied to boss battles. These are all ideas we hope to explore further during our
     next team meeting. Assuming, of course, that more team members attend and participate. </p>

  <p>Last week, Zuzanna and I agreed on the games title "A Grimm Descent" on our own due to the fact no one else showed up to the meeting. The title is a
  play on the Grimm brothers fairytales.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, I think this event highlighted a major weakness in our team, communication. As the producer, I do take some responsibility for this.
    I’ve tried to reach out and encourage participation, but I now feel extremely frustrated and unsure how to proceed. It’s become clear that some
    members are either unwilling or uninterested in contributing meaningfully to the project. I’m not sure how to move forward when the team doesn’t
    feel like a team at all. It is currently very difficult to think of a solution to this core issue when all previous attempts to motivate and organise
  our team have gone completely and utterly ignored. </p>

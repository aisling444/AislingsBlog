  <p style="text-align: center; color: #555555">Entry 2</p>
  <p>Now that our team has been decided, we began working on the concept for our game. Instead of waiting for Prince
    Charming to rescue her, our princess takes matters into her own hands, fighting through monsters, solving puzzles,
    in each level as she escapes from her tower.</p>

    <p>The game begins at the very top of the tower in the princess’s bedroom, a bright and colourful space. As she
      descends the tower, the rooms become darker and more dilapidated. Along the way, she battles monsters and solves
      puzzles, from her Evil Stepmother to a monstrous dragon, in the final level she must fight her “prince charming”
      in which it is revealed he is the one who imprisoned her all along. The final battle takes place in the dungeon,
      where she must defeat him to earn her freedom.</p>

  <p>Gameplay-wise, our game is a roguelike dungeon crawler with a mix of combat and puzzles, this decision was made
    to accommodate everyone in the team as some wanted an action packed games whereas others wanted to create a puzzle game.
    The princess starts with a magic wand, a weak but long-range weapon, and can pick up stronger weapons and a range of upgrades,
    such as a sword or bow and arrow. Combat will be fast-paced, requiring strategic dodging and attacking, with enemies varying
    from haunted furniture to knights in cursed Armor. The game will also feature an inventory system with three slots, allowing
    the princess to carry useful items like True Love’s Kiss (a healing potion), Glass Slippers (a speed boost), or Phoenix Ashes
    (a revival item). A special feature is the Rat Companion, gained in the Kitchen level, which helps the princess fight by dealing
    half her damage with each attack.</p>

  <p>The game consists of four main levels, each representing a different part of the castle: </p>
  <h5 style="text-align: center; color: #555555; font-size: medium">Level 1, The bedroom</h5>
  <p>the princess’s escape begins when she discovers a rat carrying a key. Here, she battles haunted furniture and must
    repair a broken key to unlock the door.</p>
  <h5 style="text-align: center; color: #555555; font-size: medium">Level 2, The kitchen</h5>
  <p>the Kitchen introduces more enemies, rats under a spell, the princess must create a potion to break the curse and
    she will then gain the rat companion who will help her as she descends the tower.</P>
    <h5 style="text-align: center; color: #555555; font-size: medium">Level 3, The ballroom</h5>
    <p>The third level, the Ballroom, is where the princess starts uncovering the truth about her past,
    encountering a skeleton wearing a crown with her family’s crest. This level features a unique music-based puzzle,
  where stepping on the correct floor tiles unlocks the next room.</p>
    <h5 style="text-align: center; color: #555555; font-size: medium">Level 4, The dungeon</h5>
  <p>Finally, the fourth level, the Dungeon, is the darkest and most dangerous, leading to the final confrontation with
    Prince Charming himself. The last puzzle involves navigating a pitch-black maze with only a torch to light the way.
    Once the prince is defeated, the princess escapes, throwing down her tiara and riding off on his white horse.</p>

  <p>Stat-wise, the princess’s abilities include Attack, Speed, Health, Attack Speed, and Attack Range,
    all of which can be improved through items. The Crystal Ball, found at the beginning of each level, reveals pieces of her
    backstory, adding a narrative element to her escape. There’s also an element of risk and reward, with items like the Enchanted
    Apple, which has a 70% chance of healing but a 30% chance of being poisoned.</P>

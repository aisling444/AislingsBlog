  <p>This week was Easter break, so unfortunately, we weren’t able to have a team meeting as most people had gone home.
    I felt very out of the loop regarding where we were in the game’s development. With the deadline rapidly approaching and
    little communication from the group, I was feeling incredibly stressed and overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>By Monday, I felt like I was at my wit's end, so I sent a fairly harsh message to the group chat expressing how frustrated
      I was with our lack of communication and coordination. I explained that, at this point, I honestly didn’t believe we would have a
      finished game in time. I also reiterated what my lecturer had told me about the dev diary. I told the group that
      I’d love to finish the game if everyone was willing to put in the effort, but that I couldn’t force anyone to do their share, and if the
      game wasn’t completed, I would be transparent about that in my final dev diary. Initially, both Jane and Niamh opened the message but didn’t
      reply, which made me feel even more discouraged. However, later that day Jane responded, saying she planned to finish her work that week.
      She mentioned she was working on the collection system for the power-up items but was having a small issue with the items disappearing once
      collected. The next day, Niamh replied and said she had finished the first three puzzles as well as the music. I apologised for the tone of my
      earlier message, and we all agreed to give the project a final push this week and do our best. As of Saturday, April 19th, I still haven’t
      received any updates from Luigi.</p>

  <p>The silence in the group chat throughout the week made me feel once again like the team was starting to disengage. I brought this up again, and
    Jane reassured me that she had been working consistently on most of the game’s code and that we should have a functioning game by the end of the week.
    I also voiced my concerns about how we would merge all of our work, especially since the code was being written by different people who hadn’t
    really collaborated or checked in with each other. Caithlin pointed out that most of us didn’t really understand what the others were doing, which
    led to everyone working pretty independently, which I completely agreed with, and I recognise that I’m guilty of that too. As producer, I should have
    made a stronger effort to connect the dots between everyone’s roles.</p>

    <p>To help with this, Jane and I agreed to meet on Tuesday to finalise the project together. However, due to the lack of updates from both Niamh
      and Luigi, I’m still unsure whether the puzzles or room randomisation will actually be implemented in the game. Regardless, I’m hopeful that we’ll
      have some sort of game to submit for our final grade, which is better than having nothing at all.</p>

    <p>As a team, we also made the decision to scrap the final dungeon level due to time constraints. Instead, we’re going to focus on polishing the
      first three levels and making sure they’re working as smoothly as possible.</p>

    <p>This week, I worked on a loading screen to appear between each level. I repeated the same process I used for the title screen.
      The design features the princess descending a staircase, visually implying that she’s descending further into the tower. I
      decided to use the other side profile of the princess, with the princesses head facing forwards to add more detail to the scene. Originally, I
      felt that the scene did not look right for some reason. Zuzanna pointed out that the colours of the princess did not reflect the dark
      atmosphere of the scene which made me realise I had been using a version of the princess I previously drew. To fix this I simply added a clipping
      layer with the colour of the wall and lowered the opacity. This made the princess fit much better into the scene.
      Like with the cutscenes, I uploaded the full image and each individual layer to GitHub to help with animating it later in Unity.
    Caithlin is still in the process of animating this.</p>

  <p>This week I ran into some issues with character design. Luigi was researching code to implement for our floor plan
    and Zuzanna was working on the tiles to be drawn. She needed to know the dimensions I used to draw the sprites. I
    had drawn on a 100 X 100 canvas, but I felt that the dimensions were too small and that the images came out blurry.
  I decided I needed to redraw the sprites on a bigger canvas, but I did not know what would be a good size. I consulted
  my lecturer on the issue, and he recommended working on a smaller canvas to make the pixelated style easier to achieve.
  He also suggested creating a darker outline for the sprites so they stand out more.</p>

  <p>I continued to work on a 100 X 100 canvas and began to redraw the sprites I had already drawn and worked on new sprites.
  My teammates and I agreed that a black outline looked best for our characters. I feel that the black outline makes the
  characters and their details stand out more.</p>

  <p>This week as producer I had some issues with attendance at our weekly meetings and people not engaging with their tasks
    for the week. I am still not entirely sure how to effectively resolve this issue as I do not want to create conflict
  or tension in the group, be we also need everyone to do their part for this project to be successful. I sent a message
  to all my teammates asking them to ensure they have last weeks tasks fully completed for next week. I stated that I expected
  their research to be comprehensive and ready to implement by next week and that any work/art needed to be finalised rather
    than rough concepts that would need additional work. I also warned that if someone did not attend the meeting I would assign
  tasks regardless and the entire team would expect them to be completed by the following week. I encouraged everyone to
  attend our team meeting to ensure they were assigned tasked they would be happy to complete and that their strengths could be
  utilized effectively. By next week we are hoping to have a plan for room randomisation and the code ready to be applied,
  the tiles/floor layout for the first two levels designed, weapons and items sprites designed, some sound effects needed
  for the game prepared, code for a health system ready to be implemented and more monsters for each level.</p>

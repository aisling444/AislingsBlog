  <h5 style="text-align: center; color: #9990c2; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif">Apr 21, 2025</h5>
  <p style="text-align: center; color: #39356c; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif">Entry 14</p>

  <p>Looking back, I definitely feel like I failed in my role as producer. I struggled to communicate clearly and effectively,
    and at times, I let my frustrations get the better of me. While I know I put in a significant amount of work and truly cared about
    this project, I also recognize that I fell short in fulfilling the full responsibilities of what a producer should be. While I had good
    intentions and genuinely wanted the game to turn out well, I made several mistakes that had a serious impact on how our team functioned.
    I was often afraid of coming across as annoying or pushing any buttons, so when people didn’t reply to messages or failed to update the team,
    I just let it go. I didn’t follow up, and I didn’t push for answers, even when things were clearly falling behind. This created a lack of structure in our team.</p>

  <p>One of the biggest
    issues our team faced throughout the semester was a lack of communication and coordination, which ultimately led to us working alone rather
    than as a cohesive team. As Caithlin rightly pointed out during one of our final conversations, many of us didn’t fully understand each other’s
    roles, and because of that, we ended up working independently with very little collaboration. In hindsight, I know this was something I should have
    tackled head-on. As the producer, it was my job to create that bridge between everyone, to check in, ensure everyone was on the same page, and
    foster an environment where we could all communicate clearly and regularly. Instead, I allowed people to work on their own time, assuming they
    would reach out if they needed anything. That was a mistake.</p>

  <p>Another major issue was poor organisation. We had no clear roadmap. At times, members worked on features that had already been removed from the
    plan, like Niamh’s puzzles, which she coded after the team had agreed to drop them due to time constraints. Again, this happened because I didn’t
    properly follow up after decisions were made, nor did I make sure everyone was aware of changes when messages went ignored. I did make a
    shared task list, kept track of who was doing what, and sent updates after each discussion but I slowly stopped using this Goggle Doc as no
    one was viewing it anyway. My main form of communication with my team mates was through a group chat which was not the most effectiv method to organise
    ourselves.</p>

  <p>Another issue was my own lack of experience and confidence. I don’t play many video games, therefor I have no idea what defines a 'good game'.
    This meant that I didn’t fully understand what needed to happen at every stage of the process, which in turn made it difficult to lead with authority
    or make informed decisions. I think my friends nominated me as producer because I tend to take leadership roles in group projects and am known for
    being a perfectionist. But in this case, that didn’t translate effectively. This group was larger than I was used to and made up of people I wasn’t
    familiar with, working on a topic I didn’t fully understand.</p>

  <p>It’s also important for me to admit that I fell behind on my own work at times. There were moments where I felt overwhelmed and demotivated,
    especially when it seemed like other team members weren’t engaging. Rather than pushing for clarity or seeking help, I let myself get stuck and
    started working less productively. Then, as the deadline approached, I snapped. I sent a harsh message to the group chat out of frustration,
    accusing people of not doing their part. While some of what I said may have been true, it was unfair of me to place the blame entirely on them,
    especially when I hadn’t maintained clear communication or upheld the responsibilities of my own role. I can see now that my outburst was more a
    reflection of my own panic and guilt for not keeping things on track earlier in the semester.</p>

  <p>In the end, I think we will manage to submit some version of the game, which I’m grateful for, but I know it won’t fully reflect the potential we
    had if we had worked more as a team. This project has taught me a lot about leadership and about how fear of
    conflict can be just as harmful as actual conflict. I’ve learned that being a perfectionist doesn’t automatically make you a good leader, and that
    being “nice” or non-confrontational doesn’t help when the team needs direction. But also being too harsh when the pressure sets in is not productive either.
    I hope that in future group projects I’ll be more proactive, better informed, and more confident. I’ve made a lot of mistakes during this project,
    but I also believe I’ve gained a better understanding of how to work effectively in a group setting.</p>

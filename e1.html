  <p>As we begin our Games Development assignment, our first step was to create a team of ideally 6-8 people.
    Within the first week I managed to form a team of 6. Together, we explored the different roles necessary
    in a team, and came up with me as Producer, Caithlín and Zuzanna as Technical Artists. Luigi and Niamh will
    be our Sound Engineers and Programmers, while Jane will be our Programmer. Jane is willing to help with any
    role necessary once time pressure sets in.</p>

    <p>While I am open to anyone in the group offering ideas on the genre,
    mechanics or story of the game, it has so far only been myself, Caithlín and Zuzanna engaging in it.
    As Producer I believe my role is meant to focus on managing the team and resolving any conflicts as well as
    giving out tasks. So far, I have already had a run in with conflicting opinions on the genre of the game we will
    want to create. The original two ideas, coming from Niamh, Jane and Luigi were a retro racing game or a “rags to riches”
    4puzzle princess themed game. These two ideas couldn’t be agreed on by the whole team, which quickly eliminated them in my eyes,
    as I don’t want to force anyone to work on a project they won’t be passionate about. Zuzanna and Luigi managed to come up with a
    rough idea of a rogue-like dungeon crawler which features a princess as the main character. This satisfied the entire group, as the
    story remained focused on the princess theme yet the action aspect is kept.</p>

    <p>We decided to leave it at that for our first team meeting, as this was all in the span of Week 1. The task I gave my team members
    to kickstart our project was to design items themed after fairy tales, as well as the general atmosphere of the game such as bosses,
    floor themes and such. So far it feels like we are on top of our workload, lets hope we manage to keep it up.</p>

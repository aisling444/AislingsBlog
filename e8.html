  <p>Last week, Caithlin approached me with some difficulties she was having within her role. I was very happy that one of my teammates was communicating
    an issue they were having with me, and thankfully we were able to come up with a solution together. Caithlin had originally volunteered to work on art
    alongside Zuzanna and I and she had been assigned weapon and item design. She expressed that she was not enjoying this role as it was very difficult
    to create pixel art on an IPad. I agreed to complete the item design and work on weapon design, as I had already done most of the items at this time.
    She volunteered to research animation and implement animations on items and characters. I believe this was a good compromise and work has continued efficiently.
    Caithlin has already showed me the software she found to begin creating animations. So far I have seen some rough drafts she has made for the princess walking,
    and they look great! We are both waiting on feedback from the rest of the group before moving forward with the rest of the animation, as we want everyone
    to work on a game they find visually appealing.</p>

    <p>For this past week I have focused on the design of the monsters that must be fought in each level and side profiles needed for animation.
      I really enjoyed this process as I really enjoy the creative process and being able to create my own characters that hopefully soon I will
      be able to share with others. I encountered some difficulties this week when sketching characters. Due to the pixelated aesthetic we have
      chosen to use and the 2D format, I have struggled with the anatomy and the angles the characters are drawn. Because out game will be a top-down
      game, I feel that the characters and objects should appear as if the player is looking down into the scene. I also do not play much video games,
      therefore I was very unsure how to proceed with character design. I also considered redrawing the characters I have already drawn, but I found
      this very difficult and I did not like the look of the sketches from this angle. Because Zuzanna and Luigi were inspired by the game "Binding of Issac"
    I decided to watch some videos of gameplay and Zuzanna even let me play the game on her laptop, so I could see the angle of the characters and how they
    moved. I also showed this to Caithlin so she could get a better feel for the animations we were aiming for. From my perspective, it appears that the
    characters are not drawn in a top-down angle, they are simply drawn in a direct 2D form. When walking the body turns to  the side but the head remains
    facing forward. I decided to replicate this look in my own drawings.</p>

  <p>There was some disagreement in the group about the side profile of the characters. Zuzanna felt that the heads should be facing the same direction of the body
  and Caithlin liked how I had already drawn them. I decided to draw both ideas so we could decide as a group which was better. Once again, I received little
  feedback from the group. I messaged out teams group chat asking for their opinions, and I only received an answer from those who had already expressed their
  opinion. Personally, I preferred the heads facing sideways. I could see that the others had read my message but chosen not to reply or offer their input. This
  did frustrate me. Caithlin also expressed that she felt that the princesses dress did not look right from the side and that I should change the shape. I
  did not agree with her as I was trying to keep the dress shape similar to the dress facing forward to make the animation transition more smooth. I once again
  asked for the other team members opinions on the matter. Although I did not agree I would happily change the design if that was what the majority of the group
  wanted. I once again did not receive any reply. By this time I felt very frustrated and messaged the group explaining that if they did not offer their input
  or attend lab meetings, they would have no say in decisions  made at that time. Caithlin, Zuzanna and I decided to move forward with our own decision as no
  one else offered any input. We have decided to keep the dress the same shape it is now and the heads of the characters will face forwards when walking. </p>

  <p>Because of the issues with character I outlined earlier I did struggle with some of the monsters designs. In particular, I really struggled to draw
  the suit of armour we planned to implement in the dungeon level. I did look at similar drawings on the internet but struggled to create my own version that
  was original and still resembled a suit of armour. To solve this issue, we've decided to replace the armour with ghosts in the dungeon level. This still fits in with the
  'spooky' theme we want for the dungeon and is far easier to draw. For the same reasons, I really struggled to draw the dragon. Because it is a
  key element of many fairytales, Zuzanna did not want to scrap this monster and instead offered to draw this dragon. I agreed to this compromise.</p>
